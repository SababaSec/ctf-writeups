# Reversible Sneaky Algorithm #0

## Problem

> Yavan sent me these really large numbers... what can they mean? He sent me the cipher "c", the private key "d", and the public modulus "n". I also know he converted his message to a number with ascii. For example:<br>
"nactf" --> \x6e61637466 --> 474080310374<br>
Can you help me decrypt his cipher?

## Hints

> - Read about RSA at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)>
> - If you're new to RSA, you may want to try this tool: <https://www.dcode.fr/modular-exponentiation><br>
If you like python, try the pow() function!
