# Reversible Sneaky Algorithm #1

## Problem

> Lori decided to implement RSA without any security measures like random padding. Must be deterministic then, huh? Silly goose!<br>
She encrypted a message of the form nactf{****} where the redacted flag is a string of 4 lowercase alphabetical characters. Can you decrypt it?<br>
As in the previous problem, the message is converted to a number by converting ascii to hex.

## Hints

> - The flag seems pretty short... can you brute-force it?<br>
(Note: By brute-force, we do not mean brute-forcing the flag submission - do not SUBMIT dozens of flags. Brute force on your own computer.)

## Solution

[Python script](solver.py)
