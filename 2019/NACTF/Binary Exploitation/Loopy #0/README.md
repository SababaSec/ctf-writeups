> This program is quite short, but has got `printf` and `gets` in it! This *shouldn't* be too hard, right?<br>

## Solution

This challenge is called `Loopy` because we need to call `vuln()` twice. The first time, we leak the [Global Offset Table (GOT)](http://bottomupcs.sourceforge.net/csbu/x3824.htm) value of `printf()`. The second time, we use that knowledge to call `system("/bin/sh")`.
