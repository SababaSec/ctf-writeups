# dummycrypt

## Problem

> Welcome to roll your own crypto, it's exactly as good as it sounds

[challenge.py](challenge.py)

## Solution

We are given the plaintext and ciphertext. Therefore, the logical assumption is that we need to find the key which was used to encrypt the plaintext into the ciphertext. In order to do that, we have to reverse the `encrypt()` function given.
